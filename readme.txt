A simple responsive mortgage calculator widget. Plug-n-play!

== Description ==

The Wordpress Responsive Mortgage Calculator is a jQuery widget that's designed to fit easily into any theme, on any device, at any size.

The widget is built with plenty of classes to hook into for styling, so it’s easy to override the included stylesheet.

= DISCLAIMER =

I do not vouch for the accuracy of this mortgage calculator and any results. It's pretty darn good, but the bank has the final say...

The calculator is for demonstration purposes only and may not reflect actual numbers for your mortgage. 
Assumes constant interest rate throughout amortization period; interest calculated semi-annually.
