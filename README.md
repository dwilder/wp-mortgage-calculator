WP (Responsive) Mortgage Calculator
===================================

A simple responsive mortgage calculator widget and shortcode.

## Description

The Responsive Mortgage Calculator is a jQuery widget and shortcode that's designed to fit easily into any theme, on any device, at any size. Just what every "Real Estate Agent on the go" needs.

### Features

The calculator allows your website visitors to estimate their mortgage entering:
* the total cost of the of the home,
* a down payment amount,
* an interested rate (fixed rate),
* the amortization period
* and they can select a payment period, either monthly, bi-weekly, or weekly.

The payment result is displayed below the form - very simply and very easy to follow. But for the savvy user, a click on the information icon reveals more details…

### Redesign It

The widget is built with plenty of classes to hook into for styling, so it’s easy to override the included stylesheet.

### Known Issues

The widget and short code rely on the same jQuery script at the moment. The short code seems to take precedence over the widget, meaning the widget won’t function on the same page as the shortcode.

### DISCLAIMER

The calculator is for demonstration purposes only and may not reflect actual numbers for your mortgage. Assumes constant interest rate throughout amortization period; interest calculated semi-annually.

It's pretty darn good, but the bank has the final say...
